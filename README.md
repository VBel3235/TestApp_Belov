# TestApp_Belov
This is a simple image fetching app written in Swift. 
UI is 100% programmatic, without any 3rd party libraries.
Collection view used in this app is using UIDiffableDataSource, which was presenter by Apple in 2019.
Images can be deleted by tapping on it.

In future versions of this app, search bar can be implimented to search for different images.
Also, UIDocumentPickerViewController can be implemented to store images locally or share them via different apps across the system.
Working with API, detail screen can be implemented to show who and when posted this picture.
